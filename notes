Found that there is only 1 address that is written to when the #
of goals scored actually changes. Therefore, we can't use a "list" of addresses
as previously thought. We'll have to try and reverse engineer the pointer.

Today's experimenting, that address is 0x2d35828c

Address is 0x2cc42d5c

Found basic loop of gamestate. Know that it writes to r15 the above address.
Need to figure out when r15 is written to with that address, or where 
this address is being stored or pointed to.
